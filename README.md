Syncing Backbone.js with Django
===============================

See the different branches for Rest Framework and Tastypie implementations.

Backbone.js is a fantastic tool for adding structure to your complex JavaScript applications. It provides Models, Collections, Views and more that you can extend and build your intricate client-side code with. One powerful feature is Backbone's ability to automatically sync data to a RESTful server backend. This video will take you through three different ways to implement a RESTful API to sync your Django application with Backbone - using custom class-based views, using the Django Rest Framework toolkit, and using the Tastypie API toolkit.
